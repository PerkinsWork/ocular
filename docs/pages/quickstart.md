## Summary

Ocular is a small budgeting app, initially implemented as an alternative to Google sheet's annual budget planner.
Its goal is **not** to track individual expenses, work with multiple currencies at a time or anything related (if you're looking for something like this, check out [firefly-iii](https://www.firefly-iii.org/)).

If you are not sure if it's something for you, check out the [demo](https://ocular.reinisch.io#demo).

This app comes with its own backend (by using [genesis](https://github.com/simonwep/genesis)), so the only thing you need to do is to host it somewhere.
Your data stays on your server and is not shared with anyone else.

## Repositories

There are three repositories involved with this project:
- [ocular](https://github.com/simonwep/ocular) - The main repo with the source of this documentation, the frontend and all you need to work on the app.
- [ocular-docker](https://github.com/simonwep/ocular-docker) - The docker-compose setup for the app. This is the one you want to use if you want to deploy it.
- [genesis](https://github.com/simonwep/genesis) - A generic backend powering the app. Usually no change is needed here as it's kept unrelated to the app itself (but initially made for it).
